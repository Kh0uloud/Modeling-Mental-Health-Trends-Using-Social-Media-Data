# Modeling-Mental-Health-Trends-Using-Social-Media-Data
This project explores the intersection of social media analytics, user behavior modeling, and mental health assessment using a data-driven AI approach. Utilizing the MDDL dataset, both structured metadata and unstructured textual data are analyzed to develop a robust regression model for estimating depression intensity from Twitter user profiles, interactions, and content.


### **Feature Engineering & Classification Performance**  

By leveraging **feature engineering** on users’ tweet timelines; capturing **engagement metrics, interaction and social connectivity patterns, posting behaviors, and network & influence-based features**, a **significant accuracy boost** was achieved:  
- **🏆 69% → 96.95%** 🚀  
  - Initial accuracy (**69%**) using only profile metadata  
  - Final accuracy (**96.95%**) after integrating behavioral & temporal insights  

#### **Key Takeaways**  
✅ **High-value features** beyond raw metadata are critical for accurate classification  
✅ **Domain-driven models** improve predictive capability  
✅ **Structured experimentation** enhances model performance  

#### **Baseline Models Used**  
- **Gradient Boosting**  
- **Random Forest**  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
- **Logistic Regression**  

#### **Next Steps**  
🔍 The next phase involves **incorporating NLP-based features** from user tweets. By capturing **linguistic markers of stress, sentiment shifts, and contextual cues**, further refinement in classification performance is expected, making stress detection even more robust.
